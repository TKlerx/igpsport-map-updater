# Specification Quality Checklist: Docker Build Environment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and reproducibility
- [x] Written for project stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] Functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes
- [x] Native fallback is explicitly preserved

## Notes

- Spec does not require full country generation in CI; tool/dry-run validation is acceptable before real map smoke tests.
